# Neat Pulse API Community

Welcome to the **Neat Pulse API Community** ‚Äì a collaborative space where customers, AV partners, and Neat employees come together to share projects, tools, and integrations built with the Neat Pulse API.

## üåü About This Community

This GitHub organization serves as a hub for developers working with the [Neat Pulse platform](https://pulse.neat.no). Neat Pulse is a cloud-based platform that gives IT teams centralized control over their Neat devices, making it easy to deploy, monitor, configure, and support them across any number of locations. From a single, intuitive dashboard, administrators can view device health, track room usage and environmental data, apply bulk updates, configure settings, and even remotely control a device's interface as if they were on-site.

In addition to native management tools, Neat Pulse offers an API that enables custom integrations, automated configurations, and advanced management workflows. This allows organizations to connect Neat device data to third-party platforms, trigger actions based on real-time metrics, and extend device functionality to fit unique operational needs.
